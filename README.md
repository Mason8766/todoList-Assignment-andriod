# todoList-Assignment-andriod
The purpose of this app is to allow the user to better organize their time, to ensure higher productivity. I plan on creating a todo list style app, that will allow the user to enter in a number of different tasks. This will allow the user to not only keep a reminder of what work or jobs need to be finished but can also be used as an organizational tool.  This app will serve as a reminder, and an agenda, allowing users to plan out their week according to what task they might have. While there are already lots of apps like this, most either lack features I plan to implement or only include them behind a paywall.

Technology to be implemented...

-access a database on Andriod

-user authentication and sign-in.

-Change scenes 

-Display database information into text/table view

-Drag and drop elements

-Create out of app reminders/notifications

-Style period applications

-return user-specific data from DB table(Joining tables)

-Access the system calendar, and read and write data to it.

-Navigational menus, to switch between scenes

-Upload and publish to the google play store
